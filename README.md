Project Summary:

1.Objective:
The project aims to develop an automated system for assigning workshop participants to various activities and rooms based on their preferences and team associations. This system is designed to handle the logistical complexities of coordinating room assignments and activity schedules for a workshop.

2.Application:
This automated assignment system is particularly useful for large-scale workshops or conferences where manual coordination of participant preferences, team associations, and room assignments can be highly complex and time-consuming. By leveraging data-driven algorithms, the system can efficiently manage preferences and logistical constraints, thereby enhancing the overall experience for participants and organizers.
